<p>Iâ€™m not sure what to write here but I bet this Portfolio/Blog will figure itself out eventually.
Iâ€™ll start with introductions. Like you are probably aware at this point, my name is Kim and Iâ€™m a game developer (student at the time of writing). Iâ€™ve been a programmer, game designer, and ocassionally sound designer in multiple smaller game projects. If youâ€™re interested in knowing more about my involvement Iâ€™ll be adding posts breaking down each project. Until then they are playable at my <a href="https://kimcodekill.itch.io">ITCH.IO</a>.</p>

<p>For the main part of my game development career Iâ€™ve been using C# in Unity. Iâ€™ve dabbled in Unreal and thought about Godot, but Iâ€™m satisfied with my engine of choice for now. I have a background in web development (fullstack) and at this point use it mostly for my own websites. My dream job right now is as a programmer at a game studio. Iâ€™ve learned a lot as a game development student and feel ready to put my knowledge in C#/Unity/Game Design to use.</p>

<p>Along with my studies Iâ€™m also working on a super secret indie project. I canâ€™t tell you much yet apart from â€œprocedural generationâ€. Stay tuned.</p>

<p>I hope you read something interesting on this Portfolio/Blog and any questions or business inquiries are much appreciated and directed to my <a href="mailto:KimMakesGames@gmail.com">EMAIL</a></p>
